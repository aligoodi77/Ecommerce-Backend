# 🛒 Ecommerce Project

This is a complete MERN stack **Ecommerce Web Application** built as part of a learning project.
I explored and understood both the **frontend** and **backend** structure of the app, including all core functionalities such as authentication, product management, cart system, checkout with Stripe, and Cloudinary image uploads.
